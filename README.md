Overview of the Programming Project

The output of this programming project will serve as a starting point for your A3 (which  will continue into the course project). All the programming will be done in Java/Python.
Generally, develop an interactive conversational agent that responds to user input. The  agent will need to "understand" sentences typed in by the user. (This is an open research  problem, so don't worry if your system doesn't seem to understand very much, or doesn't  do the understanding in an "intelligent" way. Find a way to develop an agent that
*mimics* understanding, such as pattern matching.)
In response to the user, the agent will need to generate sentences as output. (Consider using a wide variety of "canned" responses with variable substitutions to keep the scope of the project simple and manageable.)
To give a more realistic context to the conversational agent, you should assign it a  "role" so that the agent speak according to that role. 


Specific evaluation criteria are:

+ 5 points: Creation of individual GitHub accounts and having a team repository there.
+ 4 points: Brief description of project being done. Description and rationale for the chosen SDLC. List of limitations of the program submitted.
+ 6 points: Listing of phases, tasks, subtasks. Breadth of coverage. Meaningful breakdown.
+ 10 points: WBS including all task assignments, hour estimations, actual hours. Distribution of workload should be fair.
+ 5 points: Gantt chart with start/end dates and dependencies.

+ 10 points: Software's ability to undergo 30 turns of a dialogue. Quality of dialogue: is the conversation "smooth" and realistic? Coverage of test output provided.
+ 10 points: Software design (at the class level) and understandability of code documentation.
+ 5 points: Presentation: does the demo work? Were branches used per feature implemented? Did everyone contribute to the project in some way?
+ 5 points each round: Four rounds of peer evaluations for each of your team member. At each round, 4 points are allocated towards your ability to critique and 1 point based on your peer reports on you.
